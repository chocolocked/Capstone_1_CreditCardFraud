# Credit_Card_Fraud

Data science project:

* EDA on the dataset with visually appealing graphs 
* Model built: 
* 1. SVM with grid search for hyperparameters tuning
* 2. SVM with feature selection
* 3. SVM with SMOTE upsampling on the frauds
* 4. Random Forest with grid search for hyperparameter tuning
* 5. 3-layer ANN with Keras
* Metrics used: AUC, Precision, Recall 


## File organization

* Data: folder containing credit card transactions by Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud> 
* ProgessCheck: preliminary results of proposal, EDAs, inferentail
* FinalResults: code and graphs wrapped together in jupyterbook
